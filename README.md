### Hi there 👋

I’m a Software Engineer graduated from the HEIG-VD. I've always been passionate about technology and development. I like to start from nothing and see a project grow.

I've completed various projects in the course of the past few years and there are a few I am proud of. You can quickly find them from my [portfolio](https://vitorva.github.io/portfolio).
